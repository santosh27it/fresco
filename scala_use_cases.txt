1.write a function to check if a number passed into it is an even, function definition should be f: Int => Boolean

def even(x:Int):Boolean = {(x % 2 == 0)}

2.Create a List of any 10 numbers, and pass on the function to the list to filter the odd and even numbers and print

val isEven = (_:Int) % 2 == 0
filter(isEven, List(0,1,2,3,4))

3. Write a function which returns another function, as per the following conditions
if the number coming to the function is integer, return a function which will double the value
if the number coming to the function is odd, return a function to add 1 to it.


def bf(x: Int) = () => {
	
val isInteger = Try(x.toInt).isSuccess;
if(isInteger ){
val small_func = () => x*2 ;
	return small_func()
}
if( x%2!=0){
val small_func = () => x+1 ;
	return small_func()
}
}
